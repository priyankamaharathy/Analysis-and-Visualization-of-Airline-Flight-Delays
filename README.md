# Analysis and Visualization of Airline Flight Delays

## Description
This project performs a comprehensive analysis and visualization of airline flight delays using a dataset containing information about flight delays, cancellations, and reasons for delays. The analysis provides insights into patterns of delays, cancellations, and the performance of different airlines.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes records of airline flights, including fields such as:
- Year
- Month
- Carrier
- Carrier Name
- Airport
- Arrival Flights
- Delayed Flights
- Cancelled Flights
- Arrival Delay
- Carrier Delay
- Late Aircraft Delay

The dataset can be found at [link to dataset] (if applicable).

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand flight delay patterns.
- Visualization of flight counts, cancellations, and delay distributions using pie charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Detailed analysis of delays by airline and year.

## Usage
To run this analysis:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Airline-Flight-Delays.git
